<h2 id="experience"> 🧪 Experience </h2>
In this project I was able to consolidate my studies very well, I learned a little more about the mobile issue, it was very challenging and tiring, starting a backend with fastify for the first time, it was something really cool.

I learned a lot about Frontend too, which is my focus, the accessibility part was what caught my attention, knowing about radix-ui and tailwind, wow, it was something like 🤯.

The logical part was the most incredible, all the maps() to go through the array and return a component to the user, the includes() to check if something was in accordance with the context or business rule, it was incredible, I will definitely get ready more on these technologies.
